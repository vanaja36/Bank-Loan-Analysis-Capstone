# 🏦 Bank Loan Analysis Capstone

## 📌 Project Overview

This capstone project provides an in-depth analysis of a bank's loan portfolio, focusing on key performance indicators (KPIs), loan quality assessment, and borrower behavior. Utilizing Python for data processing and visualization, along with interactive dashboards, the project aims to support data-driven decision-making in banking operations.


## 📊 Key Features

- **Data Processing:** Cleaned and transformed raw loan data for analysis.
- **KPI Calculation:** Computed metrics such as total applications, funded amounts, repayments, average interest rates, and debt-to-income ratios.
- **Loan Classification:** Categorized loans into 'Good' (Fully Paid or Current) and 'Bad' (Charged Off) for quality assessment.
- **Visual Dashboards:** Created interactive dashboards to visualize trends, distributions, and regional patterns.
